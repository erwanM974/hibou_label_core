# HIBOU

HIBOU (for Holistic Interaction Behavioral Oracle Utility) provides utilities for
designing, drawing & manipulating interaction models, explore their semantics
and analyse outputs of distributed systems (sets of distributed logs)
with regard to formal specifications written as interaction models.

This piece of software has been developed as part of my PhD thesis in 2018-2021 at the 
[CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)
engineering school
(part of [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/))
in collaboration with the 
[CEA](http://www.cea.fr/) (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives).

## This repository

This repository holds parts of the project defining:
- the interaction language with its syntax and semantics
- basic features to parse, print and draw interactions
- a rewrite system to compute canonical forms of interactions

See "[hibou_label](https://github.com/erwanM974/hibou_label)" for the main project.
